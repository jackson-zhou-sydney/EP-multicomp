# Fast Expectation Propagation for Heteroscedastic, Lasso-Penalized and Quantile Regression
### Jackson Zhou, John Ormerod, and Clara Grazian

This repository contains fast expectation propagation code for the Bayesian versions of:

- Heteroscedastic linear regression
- Lasso-penalized linear regression
- Quantile linear regression

For each model, the performance of EP is compared to other standard Bayesian approaches.
