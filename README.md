# EP with multiple components
### Jackson Zhou, John Ormerod and Clara Grazian

This repository contains expectation propagation code (in R) for Bayesian models with two hybrid components.
These include:

- Heteroscedastic linear regression
- Lasso linear regression
- Quantile regression

For each model, the performance of EP is compared to other standard Bayesian approaches (mainly Laplace's method and mean-field variational Bayes) on some simulated data and benchmark datasets.
