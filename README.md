# EP with multiple components
### Jackson Zhou, John Ormerod and Clara Grazian

This repository contains expectation propagation code (in R) for Bayesian models with more than one hybrid component, in addition to some simple, illustrative models.
These include:

- Probit regression
- Logistic regression
- Heteroscedastic linear regression
- Lasso linear regression
- Elastic net linear regression
- Random intercept linear regression

For each model, the performance of EP is compared to other standard Bayesian approaches (mainly Laplace and mean-field variational Bayes) on some simulated data and benchmark datasets.
